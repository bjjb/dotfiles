JJ's dot-files
==============

My standard Unixy dotfiles. Provides a fairly convenient Bash environment,
with a prompt by [starship](https://starship.rs), programmery do-dads provided
by [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com), a [Vim](http://vim.org) configuration, and
sundry settings, completions, functions, and whatnot. It use it to reasonable
effect on FreeBSD, Ubuntu and MacOS.

Installation
------------

(You'll need git and curl.)

    curl -Ls https://uri.gy/9J | sh

Source `.bash_profile` (or log out and back in again) to activate the
environment.

Caveats
-------

You're free to use and abuse anything you find here, but it comes with no
warranty whatsoever.

Have fun!
