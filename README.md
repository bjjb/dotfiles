JJ's dot-files
==============

My standard *nix dotfiles. Provides a fairly convenient Bash environment, with
a prompt by [starship](https://starship.rs), programmery do-dads provided by
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com), a [Vim](http://vim.org) configuration, and
sundry settings, completions, functions, and whatnot. It use it to reasonable
effect on FreeBSD, Ubuntu and MacOS.

Installation
------------

Clone the repo and symlink the `.bash_profile` into your home directory. Or
include the `.bash_profile` into one of your startup scripts, or whatever.
You can also symlink `.vimrc` and `.vim` into your home directory, cd into
`.vim` and run `git submodule update` to get all the Vim plugins.

Caveats
-------

You're free to use and abuse anything you find here, but it comes with no
warranty whatsoever.

Have fun!
