JJ's dot-files
==============

My standard *nix dotfiles. Provides a fairly convenient Bash environment, with
a prompt by [starship](https://starship.rs), programmery do-dads provided by
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com), a [Vim](http://vim.org) configuration, and
sundry settings, completions, functions, and whatnot. It use it to reasonable
effect on FreeBSD, Ubuntu and MacOS.

Installation
------------

(You'll need git and curl.)

    curl -Ls https://uri.gy/XX | bash

Source `.bash_profile` (or log out and back in again) to activate the
environment.

Caveats
-------

You're free to use and abuse anything you find here, but it comes with no
warranty whatsoever.

Have fun!
