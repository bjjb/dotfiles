My standard *nix dotfiles. Nothing terribly fancy. Configures

* bash
* vim
* tmux
* git
* programmerey doodads
* probably some other gimmicks

and has some small programs that aren't worthy of extracting into their own
projects.

run `git clone git://github.com/bjjb/dotfiles .files; .files/install` to
install. It's pretty brutal, so don't do it if you like your existing
configuration.
